        <h2>Soccer</h2>
          <p>
            I started playing soccer when I was only 5 years old. My parents were forcing me to try every sport possible,
            but soccer was what really stuck. I started playing for recreational teams and soon fell in love with the sport.
            Around the end of elementary and the beginning of middle school, I joined a club team. During the offseason, I
            would play for an indoor league in the winter, and a recreational team in the spring. After 8th grade, I was too
            old for the club team and instead decided to tryout for my high school's soccer team. I made varsity and was a
            starter for all 4 years, along with being captain for 3. In college, I decided to focus more on my studies instead
            of becoming a student athlete. Soccer will always have a special place in my heart.

        <h2>Lacrosse</h2>
          <p>
            In my early teenage years my soccer team introcuded me to lacrosse, so i decided to give it a chance. I joined a
            recreational team where I knew some of my soccer teammates, but didn't realize how complicated the sport was so I
            ended up playing goalie. After one season, I quit and didn't return until sophomore year of high school. I made the
            varsity team and had to relearn everything about lacrosse. I was a starter for 2 years until I was too busy my senior
            year to play both soccer and lacrosse. Lacrosse definitely wasn't my favorite sport, but it did keep me in shape for
            the time being.

        <h2>Track and Field</h2>
          <p>
            In 8th grade, I wanted to particpate in a sport at my middle school. All of my friends were joining track and I
            knew the coach, so I decided to try out. I trained for the 4x100m, 400m, and 4x400m races. Our school was #1 in
            the county, and we proudly wore that on our sleeves. In 9th grade, I tried out for the outdoor track and field
            team and made varsity. In high school I was a 4x800m runner, and had a good time at all of the track meets. The
            following winter, I tried out for indoor track and field, made varsity, and prepared for the same events. After
            the first meet, I decided track was no longer for me and left the team. That was the end of my track and field
            journey!
