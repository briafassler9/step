        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
            Hi! Here are the basics about me. My name is Bria Fassler and I'm from Baltimore, Maryland. I'm currently 18 years old but on June 22nd, I'll be 19 so I'd say it's close enough. 
            I'm pretty short, 5'1" to be exact, but I'm still hoping for a last minute growth spurt. I live with my mom and dad, but have an older sister who moved out a couple of years ago. 
            I went to New Town Elementary, Deer Park Middle Magnet School, and Western Tech from grades K-12. 
            In middle school, I played the trumpet but switched to programming in high school. That's when I found out I was interested in Computer Science and wanted to pursure a career in the field.
            Currently, I'm a rising sophomore at Howard University, majoring in Computer Science.
            </p>
