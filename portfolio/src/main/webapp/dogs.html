        <h1>Pepper</h1>
          <p>
            On Christmas day in 2010, my parents surprised me and my sister with Pepper! She's a Yorkie-Poo,
            which is a mix between a yorkshire terrier and a poodle. She was named Pepper because when she
            was smaller, her coat was the color of pepper, so we thought it was fitting. Pepper is now 9
            years old, her birthday is on October 24th where she'll hit double digits this year. She's about
            the size of a toddler and knows tricks like sit, down, paw, roll over, stay, walk, and more. One
            of her favorite things to do is sit on the couch and look out the window, barking at anything that
            passes. Pepper likes to play fetch and run around at the park, but sometimes she isn't too friendly
            with other dogs. She's an amazing dog and I love her so much.

        <h1>Ginger</h1>
          <p>
            In October 2019, my sister rescued a dog and named her Ginger. She's 2 years old, but her birthday is unknown
            so instead we'll celebrate her rescue day. Also, we're not sure of her breed and the shelter didn't know, but
            we know she's a terrier mix of some sort. We don't know much about her past but we believe there was some type
            of trauma. For a couple of months, she didn't bark, and she still has bad separation anxiety. She doesn't play
            with any dog toys and usually spends her time sleeping. Over time, she's gotten comfier with our family and let
            loose. We still have a long way to go, but we show her endless support and love through her journey.
